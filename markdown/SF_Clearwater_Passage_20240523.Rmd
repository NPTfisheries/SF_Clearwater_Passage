# Background

A section of the South Fork Clearwater River near milepost (MP) 28 has been considered a potential barrier to adult steelhead migration due to high water velocities, at least during higher flows. These high water velocities are hypothesized to hinder, or periodically prevent, some adult steelhead from migrating upstream of the barrier, limiting their use of available spawning habitat upstream of the high-velocity section in the mainstem South Fork Clearwater River and its tributaries. Namely, previous work has indicated that as discharges exceed approximately 1,000 cfs within the reach, at least one very high velocity barrier emerges, exceeding burst swimming velocities for a 90 cm steelhead [@Timm2017; @Timm2018]. For reference, flow within the reach is estimated to be approximately two times flow at the previous Elk City gauge; and thus, flows at Elk City would be approximately 500 cfs [@Timm2017]. Previously, NPT staff hypothesized that a barrier emerges within this reach at discharges above approximately 600 cfs at the Elk City gage. In addition, a previous radio telemetry study conducted in 2013 - 2017 demonstrated that few steelhead spawn above river kilometer (rkm) 71, the location of the reach (Figure \@ref(fig:loc-by-rkm)).

```{r loc-by-rkm, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Study area for the Upper Walla Walla watershed fish habitat capacity assessment. Primary rivers and tributaries used by Chinook salmon and steelhead are labeled."}

<!-- CONTINUE HERE -->

This document provides a preliminary assessment of adult steelhead passage at the putative velocity barrier (hereafter barrier) based on detections of PIT-tagged adults in the South Fork Clearwater River, including at sites SC3 and SC4 located downstream and upstream of the barrier, respectively. PIT-tagged individuals include adults newly tagged at Lower Granite Dam and individuals tagged and released as juveniles at various locations including within the South Fork Clearwater River. In particular, we're interested in whether returning PIT-tagged adult observations suggest that adults passing SC3 "convert" to locations upstream of the barrier (e.g., SC4) at rates lower than expected, suggesting that the barrier hinders or prevents passage at least for some adults. Although the evaluation is focused on steelhead, we include data from PIT-tagged adult Chinook salmon for comparison.

## Study area

Figure \@ref(fig:study-map) and Table \@ref(tab:sites-table) show each of the instream PIT tag detection sites (IPTDS) used in the evaluation which detect tagged adult steelhead and Chinook salmon, including their rkm from the mouth of the South Fork Clearwater River.

# Evaluation

## Data

Our evaluation used information from PIT-tagged adult steelhead and Chinook salmon detected at any IPTDS in the South Fork Clearwater River during their upstream migration to spawn. We queried [DART](https://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart) to identify all PIT tags observed at Lower Granite Dam in returning adult steelhead and Chinook salmon, during spawn years 2022 and 2023, using the `queryObsDART()` function in the R package `PITcleanr`, and filtered those observations to identify any adult later observed at any IPTDS in the South Fork Clearwater River (Table \@ref(tab:sites-table)). Note that adult detection rates on the Lower Granite Dam adult fish ladder are essentially 100%, and thus, any PIT-tagged adult returning to the South Fork Clearwater River is expected to not be "missed". We then used the PIT-tag lists of returning adults to the South Fork Clearwater River and queried their complete tag histories in [PTAGIS](https://www.ptagis.org/) which includes their mark and release information and any subsequent observations. The complete tag histories were then "compressed" and "filtered" using the `compress()` and `filterDetections()` functions in `PITcleanr`, respectively. For steelhead, we removed any detections after May 31 during the spawn year and for Chinook salmon after September 15 to avoid detections of any kelts (steelhead only), shed tags, etc. The compressed and filtered detections for steelhead and Chinook salmon for spawn years 2022 and 2023 are available for download [here](https://github.com/NPTfisheries/SF_Clearwater_Passage/blob/main/data/derived_data/sf_clearwater_filtered_detections.csv). The filtered detections were also converted to capture histories using the `buildCapHist()` function in `PITcleanr`. Finally, biological (e.g., sex, length) and origin (e.g., natural- versus hatchery-origin) information for each tag were pulled from the Lower Granite Dam trapping database (LGTrappingDB). All data and code used in this evaluation are available at a GitHub site [here](https://github.com/NPTfisheries/SF_Clearwater_Passage).

## Release Groups

Finally, we also considered release groups when evaluating conversion rates through the high-velocity reach; adults that return from juvenile releases downstream of the reach may not have the propensity to migrate through the reach. I.e., we are primarily interested in adults returning from juvenile releases upstream of the high-velocity reach (e.g., Newsome Creek) to compare passage to SC4 relative to downstream reaches. Table \@ref(tab:release groups) shows that among adult Chinook salmon and steelhead returning to the South Fork Clearwater River in spawn years 2022 and 2023, only 22 steelhead were from a juvenile release upstream near Newsome Creek (NEWSOC). Of those 22 steelhead adults, 11 (50.0%) were observed at SC3 of which 3 (27.2%) were observed migrating through the high-velocity reach and arrived at SC4 (Table \@ref(tab:success-by-rg)).

## Discharge

We summarized conversion rates by water level (m) recorded at SC4 using the IPTDS environmental probe (Table \@ref(tab:SC4-water-level)). Above a water level of 0.8 m, only 1 of 23 steelhead that passed SC3 arrived at SC4; however, sample sizes at higher water levels are low and nearly all Chinook salmon that passed SC3 at similar water levels arrived at SC4. For this analysis, the water level recorded for each fish was the water level at SC4 when that fish was most recently observed at a site downstream of the high-velocity reach.

# Discussion

Based on PIT-tagged adult returns in spawn years 2022 and 2023, it is difficult to discern whether the high-velocity reach hinders or prevents upstream passage for steelhead. Estimated conversion rates to SC4 from SC3 were 13.9% and 15.6% for adults in spawn years 2022 and 2023, respectively; however, those rates are not considerably different than conversion rates of 29.3% and 13.4% to SC3 from SC2 (Table \@ref(tab:conv-rates)). Moreover, there were no discernable patterns to indicate that larger or older steelhead can pass the reach at higher rates than smaller fish, which would indicate that the reach is problematic for fish with weaker swimming capabilities. Very few adult steelhead were observed migrating to SC4 during water levels greater than 0.8 m at SC4 (Table \@ref(tab:SC4-water-level)) or at flows greater than ~2,000 cfs (Table \@ref(tab:cfs)), but sample sizes are low. Finally, very few adults from juvenile releases upstream of the high-velocity reach were available for the evaluation; using observation data from adult returns originating from juvenile releases downstream of the reach is problematic because we are unsure about their propensity to migrate through the reach.

The number of PIT-tagged juvenile steelhead within Newsome Creek releases was increased starting in spring 2022 (Table \@ref(tab:newsoc)); 1-ocean adults from spring 2022 releases will return to the South Fork Clearwater River in spring 2024 and 2-ocean adults in spring 2025. Similarly, juvenile releases from 2023 are anticipated to return in spawn years 2025 and 2025. Those returning adults should provide a more thorough evaluation of passage through the high-velocity reach.

```

Our evaluation used season-long estimates of detection efficiencies to expand observed tags into estimates of the total number of tags passing each IPTDS, which in turn was used to estimate conversion rates. We recognize that detection efficiencies of IPTDS can be influenced by factors including river depth or discharge; however, we used season-wide detection efficiencies largely due to lower sample sizes at more extreme flows. We will explore stratifying estimates of detection efficiency for future years if increased PIT-tag returns allows.

<!-- Mike – the steelhead released in Newsome Creek are not adipose fin clipped.  They are intended to escape mark selective fisheries.  In addition, a portion of the steelhead released at the mouth of Meadow Ck, SF Clearwater are also not adipose fin clipped.  Pasted below are tables that display this information for 2024 releases.  Table 1.2a. has the release goal number for each location and Table 1.2b has the actual expected release numbers for this spring.

Also – not sure if this has any impact or not but broodstock for the Clearwater Hatchery steelhead program is primarily collected by anglers fishing in the lower SF Clearwater.  Their target is to capture about 400 adults (and up to 475) that are removed and used for broodstock.  I guess they are essentially the same as ‘harvested’, however, I believe they keep adults that are adipose intact (not clipped) if they can determine it’s a hatchery fish (either eroded dorsal or CWT present).  Might be worth a check of IDFG database. -->
